This masterâ€™s thesis preparation will investigate two potential applications of Mixed Reality (MR) to enhance user interaction in strategic gaming and interior design. The first approach considers developing a Mixed Reality Chess Support System to assist players by visualizing optimal moves, predicting opponent strategies, and enhancing gameplay strategy in real-time. The alternative approach focuses on creating a Mixed Reality Interior Architecture System, allowing users to visualize room modifications by virtually replacing, rearranging, or removing furniture, facilitating efficient spatial planning. During this preparatory phase, both options will be explored to determine the most impactful direction for the thesis. After selection, the upcoming master thesis will be planned, including literature research and a detailed project plan.
